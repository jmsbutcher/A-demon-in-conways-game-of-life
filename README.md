# A Demon in Conway's Game of life

### Conway's Game of Life as an Environment for an Artificial Intelligence

Life's evolution has run without interference... until now.

An intelligent agent lives within the game, moving around
and turning cells on or off --- causing chaos, or perhaps
some order!

The agent has a "brain," a neural network that learns via
reinforcement learning. It "sees" the state of cells in the
environment within its visual field. This information is
fed as input into the neural net, which then outputs an action
to take: move, flip, or wait.


## Prerequisites:
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.7</li>
  <li>Numpy 1.17</li>
  <li>Pytorch 1.2.0</li>
</ul>

# Setup:
1. Make sure the above requirements have been installed
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Using the terminal, navigate into the folder containing this repository
4. Run this command:

```

- If you are using Windows 10, you may need to download Anaconda and use
**Anaconda Prompt** instead of **Command Prompt** to install Pytorch and
also to run the above command.
